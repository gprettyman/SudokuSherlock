# SudokuSherlock
Sudoku Solver (js) using backtracking and deductive solving.
Created by Grayson Prettyman - 9/28/21



**Function:** Solves a user-inputted sudoku.


**Features to add:**
~~1) Solve more complex sudoku - Currently, if the sudoku has multiple possible solutions (ie. is missing enough clues to where it could be solved multiple ways), the program will just display an error message.~~  SOLVED

2) Validate user-interface - Currently, no checks to ensure that user-input is valid (ie. contains only 9 numbers, all characters are in fact numbers, etc.)

3) More user-friendly interface - Currently, the user-input is relatively easy to understand, but is clunky and not very visual. A more graphic input would be preferable (ie. type in boxes, then clicking a "solve" button to run the solver and display the solved sudoku, etc.)
